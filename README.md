# Coles Bakery Sales Analysis Project
**This project presents an analysis of Coles Bakery Sales using data visualization and insights generated through Power BI.**

### The data source consists of two Excel sheets:

**Past Sales Data:** Details historical sales performance of bakery products.  
**Future Orders Data:** Captures future customer orders for bakery items.  

The analysis focuses on uncovering trends and insights from each dataset independently and combining them to explore relationships between past performance and anticipated future demand.

### Project Phases:
**Data Cleaning and Preparation:**

Removed duplicates, standardized fields, handled missing values, and ensured consistency across datasets.
Converted data types for accurate analysis, such as formatting date fields and numeric columns.

**Data Manipulation:**

Created calculated columns (e.g., Order Year-Month, Sales Growth) and measures (e.g., Total Sales, Order Gap, Conversion Rate).
Combined the datasets using Power BI's Merge Queries feature to analyze both datasets together.

**Analysis:**

Past Sales Analysis: Explored trends in total sales, sales quantities, and category-level performance, including insights into top-performing products and stores.
Future Orders Analysis: Analyzed order volumes, lead times, and service types, along with breakdowns by store and product.
Merged Analysis: Investigated gaps between future orders and past sales, conversion rates, and demand forecasting.

**Visualization and Reporting:**

Designed dynamic dashboards featuring interactive visuals, drill-downs, and tooltips to highlight key metrics.
